Milestone: LEAF-AUDIT | Last SPEC: SPEC-LANG-0244 | Next: COMPLETE
Phase: Audit | Status: COMPLETE | Branch: 1.2.0-alpha
Tests: 552/552 (fast) | Notes: LEAF audit COMPLETE. Audited all 300 LEAF SPECs. Findings: Many LEAFs are very minimal, missing most standard sections (Semantics, Edge cases, Failure modes, Determinism, Examples, Implementation notes, Dependencies). Algorithm details often missing. Some LEAFs have duplicate content (SPEC-LANG-0119, 0121, 0228, 0604, 0303, 1501, 0243, SPEC-FORGE-0208, 0307, SPEC-QUARRY-0204, 0305, 0404). FORGE and QUARRY LEAFs tend to be more minimal than LANG LEAFs. Well-structured LEAFs (e.g., SPEC-LANG-0840, 0841, 0850, 0870-0873, 0808-0810, 0815, 0835-0838, 0901-0903, 1001-1005, 1101-1104, 1201-1202) have good structure but often missing edge cases and failure modes. All findings appended to leaf-audit.txt (300/300 LEAFs, 100%).

State History (Last 5):
1. 2025-12-23 M11 SPEC-LANG-0409 COMPLETE | Implemented SMT solver integration (Z3, CVC5) for formal verification of @requires and @ensures contracts. Created quarry/smt_verify.py with SMT-LIB translation. Added verify command to quarry/main.py. Supports both Python bindings and CLI fallback. Added 14 unit tests. All 552 tests pass. Started SPEC-LANG-0510: Created pyrite/algorithm/algorithm.pyrite with vectorize, parallelize, tile functions. Needs parameter closure type syntax support in function parameters.
2. 2025-12-23 M11 FEATURE ADD | Implemented compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=). Updated AST Assignment node with op field. Parser handles compound operators. Type checker validates numeric types. Codegen generates appropriate LLVM instructions. Added 13 tests (6 parser, 7 integration). All 538 tests pass.
2. 2025-12-23 M11 SPEC-LANG-0405 COMPLETE | Implemented full loop desugaring for forall/exists with short-circuiting logic. Added 10 codegen tests. ForAll: returns false on first failed predicate. Exists: returns true on first successful predicate. All 542 tests pass.
2. 2025-12-23 M11 SPEC-LANG-0408 | Implemented @safety_critical attribute parsing and tracking. Added checks in codegen to ensure contracts are always checked for safety-critical functions (ready for future build-mode conditional checks). All 534 tests pass.
3. 2025-12-23 M11 SPEC-LANG-0407 | Implemented contract propagation and blame tracking. Enhanced error messages to identify caller vs callee blame. Preconditions blame caller, postconditions blame callee. All 532 tests pass.
4. 2025-12-23 M11 SPEC-LANG-0406 | Implemented compile-time contract verification with range analysis. Enhanced evaluate_constant_bool to use constraints from @requires. Added compile-time verification for @ensures. All 532 tests pass.
5. 2025-12-23 M10 REMEDIATION | Completed all 7 M10 LEAF specs: 0840,0841,0850,0870,0871,0872,0873. Fixed contract verification bug.
