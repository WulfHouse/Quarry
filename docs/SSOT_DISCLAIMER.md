# SSOT Disclaimer - Important Information

## What is the SSOT?

The **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** for Pyrite is a **high-level master specification overview** and **hypothetical wishlist** for what the Pyrite programming language and Quarry SDK are intended to eventually become.

## Key Points

### ⚠️ The SSOT is Aspirational

The SSOT represents the **vision and goals** for Pyrite, not necessarily the current implementation state. It describes:

- **Intended design** - How the language should work
- **Target features** - What features are planned
- **Vision** - Where the project is heading
- **Goals** - What we're working toward

### ⚠️ May Not Reflect Current State

**The SSOT may not accurately convey the current state of the project and monorepo.**

Features described in the SSOT may be:
- ✅ **Fully implemented** - Working as specified
- 🚧 **Partially implemented** - Some aspects work, others don't
- 📋 **Planned** - On the roadmap but not yet implemented
- 💡 **Aspirational/Hypothetical** - Ideas for future consideration

## Where to Find Current State

For accurate information about what is **actually implemented**, see:

1. **[LIMITATIONS.md](../LIMITATIONS.md)** - Known limitations and incomplete features
2. **[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)** - What has actually been released
3. **[README.md](../README.md)** - Current project status and capabilities
4. **Source code** (`forge/src/`) - Actual implementation
5. **Tests** (`forge/tests/`) - What functionality is tested (and thus implemented)

## Why This Matters

When reading the SSOT:
- ✅ Use it to understand the **intended design** and **vision**
- ✅ Use it to see **where the project is heading**
- ❌ Don't assume everything described is **currently implemented**
- ❌ Don't use it as a reference for **current capabilities**

## Example

The SSOT might describe a feature like "automatic error recovery" in detail, but:
- It may not be implemented yet
- It may be partially implemented
- The implementation may differ from the specification

Always check the source code, tests, and LIMITATIONS.md to see what's actually working.
