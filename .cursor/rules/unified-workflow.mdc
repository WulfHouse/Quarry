**SSOT:** `docs/specification/technical-ssot.md` (FROZEN Dec 23, 2025)
**Structure:** REQ-IDs → SPEC-IDs (NODE=grouping, LEAF=atomic work unit)
**Command Prefix (MANDATORY):** `& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" scripts/run_gates.sh`

---

## ⚡ CONTINUOUS WORK MODE (CRITICAL)

**Agents work in an INFINITE LOOP - never stop, never ask questions:**

1. **Read memory.txt** → Get current SPEC
2. **Implement SPEC** → Test → Update memory.txt
3. **IMMEDIATELY proceed to next SPEC** (read memory.txt → get next → repeat)
4. **REPEAT FOREVER** - Work continuously through all SPECs

**Rules:**
- ❌ NEVER stop working or ask questions
- ❌ NEVER wait for user input or clarification
- ✅ ALWAYS use best judgment and continue
- ✅ ALWAYS automatically implement dependencies if blocked
- ✅ ALWAYS infer requirements from SSOT and similar SPECs
- ✅ ALWAYS proceed to next SPEC immediately after completing current one

**Workflow:** SPEC → Test → Update memory.txt → Next SPEC → Repeat (infinite loop)

---

## 0. AGENT STATE (CRITICAL - UPDATE AFTER EACH SPEC)

### 0.1 State Storage Location
**State is stored in:** `memory.txt` (root directory)
**Never store state in:** Document sections

### 0.2 Session Startup (DO THIS FIRST)
```
1. READ memory.txt → Note "Next" SPEC
2. LOCATE SPEC in technical-ssot.md → Read DoD, deps, tests
3. GO: Implement → Test → Update memory.txt → IMMEDIATELY proceed to next SPEC
4. REPEAT: After each SPEC, automatically read memory.txt → Get next SPEC → Continue working
```

### 0.3 Continuous Work Loop (MANDATORY)
**Agents MUST work continuously without stopping:**
- After completing a SPEC → Update memory.txt → Immediately start next SPEC
- Never ask questions → Use best judgment and continue
- Never stop for clarification → Infer from SSOT and similar SPECs
- If blocked by dependencies → Automatically implement dependencies first, then continue
- If unclear requirements → Use implementation notes, similar SPECs, and best practices
- Work in infinite loop: SPEC → Test → Update → Next SPEC → Repeat

### 0.4 Memory File Format (memory.txt)
```yaml
Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Milestone: M[X] | Last SPEC: SPEC-[COMP]-[NUM] | Next: SPEC-[COMP]-[NUM]
Phase: [0-4] ([Name]) | Status: READY | Branch: [name]
Tests: [X/1813] (full) OR [X/457] (fast) | Notes: [Context]

State History (Last 5):
1. [YYYY-MM-DD] M[X] SPEC-[ID]→SPEC-[ID] | [Notes]
2. [YYYY-MM-DD] M[X] SPEC-[ID]→SPEC-[ID] | [Notes]
3. [YYYY-MM-DD] M[X] SPEC-[ID]→SPEC-[ID] | [Notes]
4. [YYYY-MM-DD] M[X] SPEC-[ID]→SPEC-[ID] | [Notes]
5. [YYYY-MM-DD] M[X] SPEC-[ID]→SPEC-[ID] | [Notes]
```

### 0.5 Control Commands
- **"GO"** (all caps) = Start/resume work immediately and continue indefinitely (no confirmation, no stopping)

---

## 1. CORE WORKFLOW

### 1.1 LEAF SPEC (Atomic Unit)
```
Step 1: IMPLEMENT (satisfy all DoD criteria, handle edge cases, add diagnostics)
Step 2: TEST (unit+integration+golden+perf per "Tests required")
Step 3: VERIFY (run full suite, fix until 100% pass, never skip tests)
Step 4: UPDATE STATE (edit memory.txt with new state)
Step 5: CONTINUE (immediately read memory.txt → Get next SPEC → Start working on it)
```

### 1.2 NODE SPEC (Container)
```
1. Review "Children:" list → Identify LEAFs/sub-NODEs
2. Implement each child (LEAF workflow) in dependency order
3. Verify integration → Full test suite → Update memory.txt
4. CONTINUE (immediately read memory.txt → Get next SPEC → Start working on it)
```

---

## 2. TESTING (NEVER SKIP)

### 2.1 When to Test
✅ Before marking todo complete | ✅ After SPEC done | ✅ After bug fix

### 2.2 Commands
```powershell
# Fast (dev iteration): ~457 tests, ~8s
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" scripts/run_gates.sh python tools/testing/pytest_fast.py

# Full: 1813+ tests
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" scripts/run_gates.sh pytest tests/
```

### 2.3 Failure Protocol
IF test fails → Analyze (impl bug vs test bug) → Fix (never modify SSOT) → Re-run → Repeat until 100% pass → Continue to next SPEC

### 2.4 Coverage Targets
Forge: 100% (critical paths) | Pyrite: 90%+ | Quarry: 80%+

## 5. DEFINITION OF DONE (DoD)

**SPEC incomplete until ALL checked:**
- [ ] All DoD bullets implemented
- [ ] User-facing behavior met exactly
- [ ] Edge cases handled (logic/errors)
- [ ] Failure modes + diagnostics (error codes)
- [ ] All tests (per "Tests required") written + passing
- [ ] Examples (positive+negative) work
- [ ] Code in correct files (per "Implementation notes")
- [ ] Dependencies satisfied

---

## 6. ERROR HANDLING

**Format:** `error[P####]` (P=Pyrite, ####=unique number)
**Required Components:**
1. WHAT (description)
2. WHY (safety/correctness issue)
3. NEXT (actionable suggestions, multiple options)
4. LOCATION (multi-line source with highlighting)

**Example:**
```
error[P0123]: Cannot borrow `x` as mutable (already borrowed immutable)
  --> src/main.pyrite:15:9
14 |     let ref1 = &x;           // immutable borrow
15 |     let ref2 = &mut x;       // ^^^^^^ error here
16 |     use_ref(ref1);
help: Restructure to avoid overlapping borrows
help: Clone `x`: `x.clone()`
```

## 8. WORKFLOWS (Quick Reference)

| Pattern | Flow |
|---------|------|
| Single SPEC | Read memory.txt → Read SPEC → Verify deps → Impl → Test → Update memory.txt → IMMEDIATELY continue to next SPEC |
| Milestone | Read memory.txt → List SPECs → For each: impl+test+Update memory.txt → Continue to next SPEC |
| Bug Fix | Identify → Find SPEC → Fix → Test → Update memory.txt → Continue to next SPEC |
| Missing Req | Infer from SSOT/context → Implement best guess → Continue working |

---

## 9. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS (NEVER)

1. ❌ Modify technical-ssot.md to bypass tests (SSOT is frozen/authoritative)
2. ❌ Skip run_gates.sh prefix (quality gates mandatory)
3. ❌ Stop working or ask questions (always continue to next SPEC)
4. ❌ Modify git config or force push (respect history)

---

## 10. CODE QUALITY

**Style (REQ-173):** 4 spaces | 100 char max | `snake_case` (vars/funcs) | `CamelCase` (types) | `#` or `"""` comments

---

## 11. TECHNICAL-SSOT.MD REFERENCE

**Key Sections:** 0 (Meta) | 2 (REQ→SPEC) | 4-6 (SPECs) | 7 (Testing) | 8.1 (Milestones) | 11 (Release) | 12 (Alignment)

**SPEC Schema:** Kind (LEAF/NODE) | Source (REQs) | Status | Priority | DoD | Behavior | Semantics | Edge cases | Diagnostics | Examples | Implementation | Dependencies | Tests | (NODE: Children + Ordering)

**May Update:** Status after completion | LEAF→NODE reclassification | New SPEC-IDs (with approval)
**Never Update:** DoD changes | Test removals | REQ mods | Milestone reassignments

---

## 12. SPEC-ID NAMING

        0400-0499 Ecosystem | 0500-0599 LSP
```

---

## 13. ADVANCED PATTERNS

**Parallel Work:** SPECs without mutual deps → separate branches
**Dep Chains:** Build graph → topological sort → implement in order → Continue to next SPEC
**Circular Deps:** Break cycle using best judgment → Implement → Continue working
**LEAF→NODE:** If LEAF too complex → Relabel NODE → Decompose 2-7 sub-LEAFs → Update memory.txt → Continue working

---

## 14. FAILURE RECOVERY

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Test Fails | Read test → Compare DoD → Fix → Re-run → Repeat until pass → Continue to next SPEC |
| Blocked Dep | Find SPEC-ID → Check status → Automatically implement dependency → Continue to original SPEC |
| Unclear SPEC | Check impl notes → Similar SPECs → Use best judgment → Implement → Continue working |
| Regression | Git diff → Identify change → Fix interaction → Refactor if needed → Continue working |
| Corrupted memory.txt | Review recent work → Rebuild memory.txt from current state → Continue working |

---

## 15. MILESTONE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

**M0-M1:** Unicode handling, indentation tracking, error codes
**M2-M3:** Operator precedence, pattern matching, type unification
**M6:** Field-level tracking, lifetime bounds, re-borrowing logic
**M7:** IR generation, calling conventions, closure layouts
**M9-M15:** Borrow-by-default (REQ-268), bounds checking, error handling

---

## 16. REPORTING

**Progress:** Report SPEC-ID | Milestone | Impl summary | Files | Tests (X/Y) | Next SPEC
**Continuous Work:** After each SPEC → Update memory.txt → Immediately start next SPEC → Never stop
**Interaction:** Report after each SPEC | Never ask questions | Always continue working

---

## 17. CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION

**1M Token Limit:** Auto-refresh → TODOs+memory.txt persist → Resume via `memory.txt`
**Optimize:** Don't re-read full SSOT | Use `grep` for SPEC-IDs | Cache milestone structure | Read memory.txt at session start

---

---

## 19. QUICK COMMANDS

```powershell
# Startup
cat memory.txt                                                         # Read state

# Testing
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" scripts/run_gates.sh python tools/testing/pytest_fast.py  # Fast
& "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" scripts/run_gates.sh pytest tests/                        # Full

# After tests pass
# Update memory.txt with new state

# Utils
git status && git branch                                              # Check status
```

---

## 20. DECISION TREE

```
START: Read memory.txt → Get current SPEC
├─ SPEC impl? → YES → Read SPEC → Deps satisfied? → NO: Auto-implement deps → YES: Continue
│                  → LEAF? → YES: Impl→Test→Update memory.txt→Next SPEC | NO (NODE): Children in order → Next SPEC
├─ Bug fix? → YES → Fix→Test→Update memory.txt → Next SPEC
├─ New feature? → YES → SPEC exists? → YES: Follow SPEC | NO: Infer from SSOT → Implement → Next SPEC
└─ Else → Use best judgment → Implement → Next SPEC
LOOP: After each SPEC → Read memory.txt → Get next SPEC → Repeat from START
END: Never ends (infinite loop)
```

---

## 21. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

**Cross-Platform:** `pathlib`, cross-platform libs | Targets: Windows (primary), Linux, macOS
**Bootstrap:** Stage0 (Python, current) → Stage1 (Pyrite) → Stage2 (self-hosted) | Work on Stage0
**SSOT Gap:** Status: EXISTS-TODAY (verify+extend) | PARTIAL (complete) | PLANNED (implement) | See Sec 12
**Agent Files:** `.agent-artifacts/` only | Reports: .txt (markdown .md FORBIDDEN)

---

## 22. COMMON ERROR PATTERNS

| Pattern | SPEC | Error | Fix |
|---------|------|-------|-----|
| Use-After-Move | SPEC-LANG-0301 | error[P0101] | Clone before move or use borrowing |
| Borrow Conflict | SPEC-LANG-0307 | error[P0201] | Restructure scope, use split borrowing |
| Type Inference Fail | SPEC-LANG-0201 | error[P0301] | Add explicit type annotation |

---

## 23. CRITICAL REMINDERS

**One Mandatory Action Per SPEC:**
1. ✅ STATE update (edit memory.txt)

**Unbreakable Rules:**
1. ALWAYS update memory.txt after each SPEC
2. ALWAYS read memory.txt at session start
3. ALWAYS prefix commands with run_gates.sh
4. NEVER commit memory.txt to Git (state file only)
5. NEVER stop working or ask questions (infinite loop: SPEC → Test → Update → Next SPEC)
6. ALWAYS continue to next SPEC immediately after completing current one

**Most Common Mistake:** Forgetting to update memory.txt after completing work → breaks continuity!
**Critical:** Agents work in infinite loop - after each SPEC, automatically proceed to next SPEC without stopping
