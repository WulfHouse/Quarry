# WulfHouse Trademark Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 22, 2025

## 0. Owner and Purpose

WulfHouse (the public-facing name used by Alexander Rose Wulf, an individual) owns and controls the Marks covered by this policy.

This policy exists to:

* reduce user confusion about what is **official** vs **third-party**,
* protect users from deceptive or unsafe distributions and services, and
* preserve the goodwill associated with Pyrite and Quarry.

This policy is about **trademarks and branding**. Licensing of source code is governed separately by the applicable software license (see LICENSE.md).

## 1. Covered Marks

"Marks" means any trademark, service mark, trade name, logo, trade dress, or brand identifier owned or used by WulfHouse in connection with the Project, including at minimum:

* WulfHouse
* Pyrite (the programming language)
* Quarry (the official Pyrite SDK, which includes the official Pyrite language code, Pyrite's official "Forge" compiler, official Pyrite dev tools, and the official Pyrite package manager; Quarry encompasses all official Pyrite development software)
* Forge (the official Pyrite compiler name, with special treatment as described in the Compiler naming note (Forge) section below)
* Any associated logos, wordmarks, and distinctive visual identity
* Any confusingly similar variants (including misspellings, spacing changes, homographs, punctuation changes, stylization, or lookalike branding)

Marks may be registered or unregistered.

### Compiler naming note (Forge)

* "Forge" is the name of the official Pyrite compiler as distributed within the Pyrite/Quarry ecosystem.
* This policy does **not** claim exclusive rights to the word "Forge" in general, nor for compilers outside the Pyrite ecosystem.
* However, you may not use "Forge" in a way that implies your compiler or service is the official Pyrite compiler or is endorsed by WulfHouse if it is not.
* Forge is listed in the Covered Marks above with special treatment: while WulfHouse does not claim exclusive rights to the word "Forge" in general, use of "Forge" that creates confusion about official status or endorsement is prohibited.

## 2. Definitions

* **Project**: Pyrite and Quarry, including official distributions by WulfHouse.
* **Official**: published or operated by WulfHouse, or explicitly designated in writing by WulfHouse as official.
* **Third-party**: not Official.
* **Confusingly Similar**: likely to cause a reasonable person to believe a Third-party offering is Official, affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by WulfHouse.
* **Use**: any use of a Mark in names, logos, UI, marketing, domains, social handles, metadata, SEO tags, repository org/user names, package names, app store listings, or advertising.

## 3. What You MAY Do (Generally Allowed Uses)

### 3.1 Nominative (Descriptive) Use

You may use the Marks to truthfully refer to the Project to identify what you are talking about (nominative fair use), for example:

* "Pyrite programming language"
* "Quarry SDK"
* "Compatible with Pyrite"
* "Works with Quarry"

Conditions:

* The statement must be accurate.
* The use must be no more prominent than necessary.
* The use must not imply endorsement or Official status.

### 3.2 Attribution

You may state that your software uses or supports Pyrite/Quarry and identify the origin, provided you do not imply endorsement.

### 3.3 Community Content

You may create tutorials, guides, videos, talks, blog posts, and similar content and use the Marks in titles and descriptions if it is clear you are not Official.

### 3.4 Compatibility-Oriented Naming for Extensions

You may name Third-party add-ons in a way that indicates compatibility, such as:

* `pyrite-<thing>`
* `quarry-<thing>`

Conditions:

* Do not imply Official status (for example, avoid "official", "certified", "recommended", "core", "foundation", "team", or "verified" unless you have written permission).
* Do not use Official logos.
* Use the disclaimer in Section 6 when applicable.

## 4. What You MAY NOT Do (Prohibited Uses)

### 4.1 Impersonation and Confusion

You may not use the Marks in any way that is Confusingly Similar or that could lead people to believe your product, service, fork, repository, organization, or communications are Official or endorsed by WulfHouse.

### 4.2 Logos and Trade Dress

You may not use Official logos, trade dress, or confusingly similar designs without explicit written permission.

### 4.3 Naming Your Company or Primary Product

You may not name a company, organization, or primary product/service "Pyrite", "Quarry", "Forge", or "WulfHouse" (or Confusingly Similar variants) without written permission.

### 4.4 Misleading Marketing and Claims

You may not:

* claim "official" status without written permission,
* state or imply endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation when it does not exist,
* use the Marks in a way that suggests WulfHouse is responsible for your security, support, warranties, or service operation.

### 4.5 Metadata, SEO, and Advertising Abuse

You may not use the Marks in a way intended to mislead through:

* ad keywords that imply Official status,
* deceptive page titles/headlines,
* deceptive repository or package descriptions,
* app store listings that imply Official status.

Truthful compatibility statements are allowed.

## 5. Forks and Modified Distributions

If you distribute a fork or modified version of Pyrite/Quarry tooling or SDK:

You MUST:

* clearly mark it as modified and Third-party,
* choose a distinct name that does not present "Pyrite", "Quarry", "Forge", or "WulfHouse" as the primary brand,
* include the disclaimer in Section 6 prominently (README and download/install pages),
* remove Official logos and confusingly similar branding.

You MUST NOT:

* call your fork/distribution "Pyrite <something>", "Quarry <something>", or "Forge <something>" as the primary name (e.g., "Pyrite Pro", "Forge Pro"),
* use the Marks as the dominant brand identity of the fork.

You MAY:

* include a descriptive statement such as "Fork of Pyrite" or "Derived from Quarry" in a subtitle or description.

## 6. Required Disclaimers for Third-Party Projects

If you operate a Third-party tool, library, website, distribution, or service that references the Marks, you must include a clear disclaimer such as:

> "This is an unofficial, third-party project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by WulfHouse."

Placement requirements:

* Websites: footer plus any download/install page
* Repositories: near the top of the README
* Services: landing page plus documentation (and pricing page, if any)

## 7. Domains and Social Handles

You may not register or use domains or social handles that are Confusingly Similar or that suggest Official status, including names that imply:

* "official", "foundation", "core team", "maintainers", "security", or "registry" affiliation with WulfHouse.

You may run community sites if the name clearly distinguishes it as Third-party (for example, including "community", "unofficial", or a distinct brand name) and you follow Section 6.

## 8. Hosted Services and Ecosystem Platforms

You may not brand a Third-party hosted service or ecosystem platform with the Marks in a way that suggests it is Official. This includes services resembling:

* online playgrounds / browser-based execution
* hosted compilation/build/test services
* package registries, publishing endpoints, package indexes, search/browse portals, mirrors, or ecosystem dashboards

Even if your service is clearly Third-party, you must avoid Confusingly Similar naming and must include the disclaimer in Section 6.

## 9. Merchandise

You may not sell merchandise using the Marks (including logos) without written permission.

## 10. Permission Requests

If you want to:

* use Official logos,
* claim Official status,
* use a Mark as part of your primary brand name,
* sell merchandise using the Marks,

you must obtain written permission from WulfHouse.

## 11. Reservation of Rights; Goodwill

All goodwill arising from use of the Marks inures solely to the benefit of WulfHouse. No license is granted except as expressly stated in this policy. WulfHouse reserves all rights not expressly granted.

## 12. Enforcement and Changes

WulfHouse may request changes to branding or naming that creates confusion. If you do not comply within a reasonable time, WulfHouse may treat continued use as trademark infringement and pursue available remedies.

WulfHouse may update this policy from time to time. Continued use of the Marks should follow the latest published version.
