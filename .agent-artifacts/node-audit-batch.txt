SPEC-LANG-0200: Type Checking System
================================================================================

**NODE Definition (Line 6857-6951):**
- Kind: NODE
- Source: REQ-003, SSOT Section 4
- Status: EXISTS-TODAY
- Priority: P0
- Ordering rationale: Type inference must precede compatibility checks.

**Children:**
- 35 LEAFs listed (SPEC-LANG-0201 through SPEC-LANG-0246)

**Analysis:**
SPEC-LANG-0200 is a large NODE grouping all type checking functionality. It has 35 children, all LEAFs. The children cover:
- Type inference, compatibility, coercion
- Generic types, traits, lifetimes
- Primitive types (int, float, char, string, unit, slice)
- Composite types (struct, enum, union, optional, result)
- Compile-time features (const fn, comptime parameters, assertions)
- Advanced types (HKT, dyn Trait)
- Type aliases and conventions

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Very large NODE**: 35 children is a lot for a single NODE. This suggests:
   - The NODE might benefit from decomposition into sub-NODEs (e.g., "Primitive Types", "Composite Types", "Generic Types", "Compile-time Types")
   - However, all children are LEAFs, so decomposition is complete
   - The large size makes it harder to navigate and understand the structure

2. **All children are LEAFs**: ✓ Good - fully decomposed, but organization could be improved

3. **Coverage appears comprehensive**: All major type system features are covered

**Verdict:** COMPLETE BUT LARGE
- All 35 children are LEAFs with proper DoD
- Coverage is comprehensive for type checking
- Recommendation: Consider decomposing into sub-NODEs for better organization (e.g., SPEC-LANG-0200-Primitives, SPEC-LANG-0200-Composites, etc.)

**Coverage Status:** COMPLETE (All children are LEAFs, comprehensive but large)
