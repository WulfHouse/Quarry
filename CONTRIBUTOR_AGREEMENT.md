# Pyrite / Quarry Pull Request Contributor Agreement (PRCA)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 22, 2025

This Pull Request Contributor Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between:

- **Licensor:** WulfHouse (the public-facing name used by Alexander Rose Wulf, an individual), including any successor that lawfully acquires control of the Project ("Licensor", "we", "us"), and
- **You:** the individual or legal entity submitting a Contribution ("Contributor", "you").

If you submit on behalf of an employer or other entity, "you" includes that entity and you represent that you have authority to bind it.

---

## 1. Acceptance and Effective Date

By submitting a pull request or otherwise submitting a Contribution to the Project, you represent that you have read and understood this Agreement and agree to be bound by it.

This Agreement becomes effective immediately upon Submission, without any further action by Licensor.

If you do not agree, do not submit a Contribution.

## 2. Definitions

- **"Project"** means Pyrite (the programming language) and Quarry (the official Pyrite SDK), including Forge (the official Pyrite compiler within the Pyrite/Quarry ecosystem), and any related repositories controlled by Licensor.
- **"Contribution"** means any work of authorship you submit that is intended to be incorporated into the Project, including code, patches, pull requests, commits, tests, documentation, designs, and other materials.
- **"Submission"** means the act of transmitting a Contribution to Licensor or the Project through any channel Licensor accepts, including pull requests, commits, patches, or attached files in issue trackers.
- **"Your Copyrights"** means copyright and neighboring rights you own or control in the Contribution.
- **"Your Patent Claims"** means patent claims you own or control that are infringed by Licensor or recipients making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, or otherwise exploiting the Contribution, either (a) on its own, or (b) in combination with the Project as it exists at the time of Submission.
- **"Necessarily Infringed"** means there is no reasonable non-infringing alternative for practicing the Contribution (or the Contribution combined with the Project as it exists at Submission). Patent claims that would be infringed only by modifications not contained in the Contribution are not included.
