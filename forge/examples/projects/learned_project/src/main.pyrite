# Learning: Basic ownership concepts
# - Primitives (int) are Copy types, so they don't move
# - Ownership rules apply even for simple operations

fn add_one(x: int) -> int:
    return x + 1

fn main():
    let number = 5
    
    # int is Copy, so this doesn't move
    let result = add_one(number)
    
    # number is still usable because int is Copy
    print("Original:", number)
    print("Result:", result)
