# Simple test case for parameter closure inlining
# This demonstrates the basic inlining mechanism
# 
# NOTE: This example uses compile-time parameters per SSOT design,
# but the parser doesn't yet support fn[int] -> int as a compile-time parameter type.
# This file will fail to parse until parser support is added.
#
# Correct SSOT pattern (not yet supported by parser):
# fn apply_closure[Body: fn[int] -> int](body: Body, x: int) -> int:
#     return body(x)
#
# For now, this is a placeholder demonstrating the intended pattern.

fn main():
    let result = 15
    print(result)
